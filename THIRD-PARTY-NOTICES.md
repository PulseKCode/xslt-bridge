| Part of this project | Derived from | License |

| `src/`, `dist/` | Behavior of Chromium's Blink `XSLTProcessor` (output method defaults, result post-processing, collation settings, registered extensions). No Blink code is included in the engine. | - |

| `tools/oracle/blinkxslt.c` | `ExsltNodeSetFunction()` adapted from Chromium `third_party/blink/renderer/core/xml/xslt_extensions.cc`, itself taken from libexslt | MIT-style |
